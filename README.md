# Dragon-slayer

--> This is an update on the initial dragon-slayer project that I have created as a part of the Vue Course that I have been following. (https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/)

--> This is the first project that is introduced in the course and therefore it aims to practice Functions, Loops and other basic functionalities/capabilities that Vue.js provides. The initial version can also be visited in my Github repositories, or from here (https://github.com/berk245/dragon-slayer-first)

--> As the new topics and functionaities are introduced later in the course, I wanted to revisit and apply the new skills to my old project. The newly added features are as follows: Components, eventBus, Single Page Application.


## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
